Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
    Small number of simulations was predicted to be faster and time is supposed to increase e.g
    between 10 and 100 simulations which can be slightly surprising.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
    I can call predictions "good enough" after 1000 of simulations, since they seems to be stable on larger value of N
